   Data Visualisation: Empowering Business with Effective Insights

**Project Overview:**
I was tasked with analysing available data to understand key revenue drivers & growth opportunities. I also provided actionable insights to the CEO and CMO. The results of my analysis was presented through a Power BI dashboard to aid decision-making and expansion planning.

**Project Goals:**
- Analyse revenue-driving factors from operational and marketing perspectives.
- Identify key strengths and growth opportunities.
- Provide insights for strategic planning & expansion.
- Present findings through visualisations tailored to requirements.

**Dataset:**

**Data Cleanup Phase:**
I identified and excluded inaccurate data (returns, negative quantities, and negative unit prices). I also utilised conditional formulas to filter out incorrect data, ensuring good quality data for my analysis.

**Visual Creation Phase:**
Per the request, I created separate tabs for each task's visualisations, and utilised Power BI to create my visuals for the data.

**Presentation and Analysis Phase:**
My findings were presented as a video presentation piece in which I explained the process taken to clean the data and my rationale for each visualisation. I then discussed the insights gleaned from the data along with the implications for the business strategy.

_1. Data Analysis and Visualisations:_
Time Series Revenue Analysis - I created a time series line chart showcasing the monthly revenue and seasonal variations for the requested year.

_2. Top Revenue-Generating Countries Analysis:_
A bar chart was utilised to identify and showcase the top revenue-generating countries (excluding the UK) which included the quantities sold.

_3. Top Customer Revenue Analysis:_
A matrix tabe was used to identify the top 10 customers by revenue in a descending order. I included revenue as a monthly view to ensure quick oversight of any variations in customer revenue.

_4. Product Demand by Region Analysis:_
A waterfall chart was used to identify the regions with high product demand to guide the business's expansion strategy.
